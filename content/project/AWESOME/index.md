AWESOME is a new band-1 SCUBA-2 large program starting 2020 to observe a sample of carefully selected massive lensing clusters, 
which will allow us to integrate the images down to a noise level of 0.8-0.9 mJy/beam at 450 micron. The ultimate objective is 
to construct number counts down to 0.1 mJy level so below the 450 micron confusion limit by roughly an order of magnitude, by 
exploiting the power of gravitational lensing. With simulations we show that the proposed observations will allow us to determine 
the shape of the faint-end number counts, the point of turnover, and by integrating the counts the extragalactic background light
to a precision of ~20%, a ~35% improvement over the widely adopted measurements from the COBE satellite.
