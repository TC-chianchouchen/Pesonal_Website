RAGERS, the RAdio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey, is a JCMT Large Program, which has been awarded 168 hours of SCUBA-2 time (Band 1 and 2) 
to map the overdensities of dusty galaxies within the Mpc-scale environments of a sample 33 powerful radio galaxies uniformly distributed across 
a well-defined redshift and mass range.
